Pseudocode for MPC of Multiple Input System Using Bisection Method
_________________________________________________________________________

- create model of system (predefined)
- create prediction horizon (predefined)

1). evaluate the model in the range of the prediction horizon
2). calculate cost for each component of the prediction output
3). optimal point is that where the overall cost is lowest
4). calculate the input force required to reach optimal conditions

Process with respect to input:
[q0, u] -> q(q0, u) -> C(q) -> dC(q)
such that...
dC(q) < eps
where...
q0 = initial state         q = next state
u = tested input
C = cost of state          dC = change in cost
eps = absolute tolerance
_________________________________________________________________________

Notes:
  - For multiple inputs, independent cost functions will be developed
     for each control point
  - Bisection method has calculation depth, 'O(n)', of...
      O(n) = log(n)^k
    where 'n' is the range of possible inputs and 'k' is the number
    of control points
  - Goal of the 'Parallel' calculation architecture is to adjust the
    above depth to the following...
      O(n) = k*log(n)
    which is depending on the same inputs as above.

Pseudocode for Multivariate Bisection Method
Note: target is the local minimum (unknown)
      calculate until the change in cost is small

01|  choose acceptable absolute tolerance (eps)
02|  initialize initial starting range (-um, um)
03|  initialize average of range (uave)
04|  initialize difference in values to Inf (arbitrary)
