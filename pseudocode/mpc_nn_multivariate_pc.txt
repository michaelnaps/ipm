Pseudocode for Multivariate Nonlinear Newton's Method Optimization
____________________________________________________________________________

Goal: Optimize a give cost function by adjusting the input on a
  statespace with the intended parameters. In other words, find the
  point where the gradient of the system of cost functions is equal
  to zero.

    C(q) -> C(u)      (cost system is indirectly controlled by u)
    J(q) -> J(u) = 0  (gradient system of equations)

  To find this point, the system and its gradient will be found by
  iterating the cost function and solving for its gradient using a
  system similar to ode45() in MATLAB (for initial testing).

  Needed Parameters:
    System of equations for cost.
    Method of calculating gradient for cost function.

  When J(u) is calculated, the next step of the Newton's method is...
    U = u - C(u) / J(u)
  where U is the new input value to be iterated on.
